# Anaerobic Pyrolysis Chamber (APC)
The anaerobic pyrolysis chamber (APC) was devised to provide a well-defined gas atmosphere (typically inert) in a controlled elevated temperature environment. The APC is comprised of a chamber machined from stainless steel that may be sealed and placed inside a muffle furnace. The initial purpose of the APC was to force ligno-cellulosic samples through thermal degradation so that additional tests could be conducted to characterize the thermo-physical properties of the residual mass. The chamber was designed to be sealed and constantly purged with the desired gas. In the case of the ligno-cellulosic samples, the purge gas was selected as nitrogen to prevent oxidation of the produced char or any spontatneous combustion of the produced effluent. 

This repository is divided into two directories: 01_Design and 02_Controls. 01_Design includes editable geometry files and schematics in PDF form and 02_Controls includes the programs written to control the APC and log data.
